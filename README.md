------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pinn library is an easy to use pythonic interface around the Pinn REST API. It provides
idiomatic and intuitive actions against API resources, and allows for a simplier path to 
integrating Pinn with your current python project.

## Installation

The easiest way to get started is:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pinn
```

Alternatively you could also install directly from source like so:
```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Documentation

For a full run down of the library please see the reference documentation here. Otherwise keep reading on for basic usage required for any integration.
